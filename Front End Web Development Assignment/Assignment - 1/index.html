            Delhi Capitals captain David Warner has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their
            IPL match
            against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium here. Delhi defeated Sunrisers by
            seven runs in a
            low-scoring match on Monday night. "As it was his team's first offence of the season under the IPL's Code of
            Conduct
            relating to minimum over-rate offences, Mr. Warner was fined Rs. 12 lakh," IPL said in a statement on
            Tuesday.</p>

            team, for the forthcoming
            World Test Championship final.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > A true veteran of the game, Ajinkya Rahane has given his stocks a big boost for consitent
            performances in the Indian
            Premier League (IPL) 2023 for Chennai Super Kings. Though it's been a while since Rahane played for the
            Indian national
            team, his IPL form could see him earn a recall in the Test team for the forthcoming World Test Championship
            final
            against Australia. With Shreyas Iyer out injured, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sources
            informed NDTV
            that Rahane could be in line for a return.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > It was in January last year that Rahane last featured for the Indian team in a Test match. His
            appearance came against
            South Africa at Newlands. Since then, the veteran batter has been on the sidelines, owing to poor form.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > Though T20 and Test cricket stand poles apart from each other, Rahane's exploits for CSK seem
            to have impressed the BCCI
            bosses who are contemplating his return for the WTC final.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > So far in the 16th edition of IPL, Rahane has scored 209 runs at an average of 52.25 and a
            strike-rate of 199.04. In a
            recent press conference, the right-handed batter also spoke about making an impression.

            > About a possible India return, Rahane said that he isn't thinking too much about what isn't in his hands
            and only wants
            to focus on doing well for Chennai.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > "I just want to keep batting the same way, keep contributing to the team, not thinking too
            much about myself, the
            results, and the outcome. If I do that I will be really happy," he said. <br><br><br>

            > Rahane also said remains hungry for doing well for his team, be it while playing for his franchise in the
            IPL or India. <br><br><br>

            > "Intent for me is all about doing well for the team, whether I'm playing for CSK or Indian team. Keep
            thinking about the
            team rather than thinking about yourself, you own result or the outcome. <br><br><br>

            > "Intent is about how badly you want to do well for your team, and how badly you are thinking about your
            team. So that's
            my only thing," he concluded. <br><br><br>

        <p id="coffee"> > Fans rejoiced as veteran batter Ajinkya Rahane made his return to the Indian squad for the
            World Test Championship final
            against Australia. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the squad on Tuesday, handing
            the
            34-year-old a return for the summit clash against Australia in June. It was at the start of last year that
            Rahane had
            featured in the whites for India, playing against Australia. Having done the hard work in domestic cricket
            and shown
            exemplary form in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the 34-year-old
            impressed the
            selectors enough to earn a recall.</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > Rahane's comeback after 15 months was on predictable lines after Shreyas Iyer's back injury
            ruled him out of the grand
            finale. Iyer has undergone surgery in the UK for a lower back stress fracture. <br><br><br>

            > Rahane played the last of his 82 Tests in January 2022 against South Africa in Cape Town. Here's how fans
            reacted to his
            return:</p>

        <p id="coffee"> > I had been thinking, and chatting to people, about India's squad for the WTC Final. And
            whichever way I looked at it, I
            was zeroing in on this team. That suggests there weren't too many choices. The only real talking point is
            the return of
            Rahane. Looks in good form, not slogging…</p>

            night.
            Tonight we lacked intent, unfortunately we are letting us down because of a lack of intent. I would love to
            do that to
            be honest, something I quite enjoy doing, guys need to work hard [on motivating the team]. <br><br><br>

            for him. During his low
            phase, Kohli mentioned recently, how Anushka gave him the right feedback. He also went on to say that had it
            not been
            for Anushka, the Indian batting great would have turned into an 'egoistic maniac'. "When you go back from a
            space like
            this. It's easy immediately to go like 'ah, everything is so good and it's okay'. That's why I say Anushka's
            name first
            because she has seen the challenges of being in this position. She knows it. She has been there for so many
            years. She
            knows what it takes to handle public pressure. So, her conversations with me has always been priceless. She
            tells me the
            truth, simple," Virat Kohli said in a conversation with ex-CSK star Robin Uthappa on Jio Cinema.

            me in check.

            indulged in other
            fun activities. In one of the activities, Anushka's celebration was uncannily similar to what Kohli usually
            does after
            his team gets a wicket or he scores big. <br><br><br>
