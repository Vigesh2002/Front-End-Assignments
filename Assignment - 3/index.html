        <p>Brrrrr it’s getting cold out, the days are shorter and soon it’ll be winter! Fall means that more than 4 billion
            birds
            will stream overhead on their fall migration to warmer grounds down south, where they will feed and mate.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite places to see this migration in action is in New Mexico at Bosque del Apache <span>National Wildlife</span>
            Refuge.
        
            <br><br><br><br>
        
            The refuge is famous for being a critical stopover for a number of different migrating species, though for me the
            sandhill cranes and snow geese are a fan favorite. Their numbers are so great that they blot out the sky. If you are
            lucky enough to be near an area they are landing to feed, it can almost be overwhelming as their calls can be
            deafening.
            The refuge is about 2 hours south of Albuquerque, which is the biggest city in the state
        
            <br><br><br><br>
        
            The best times to visit are <span>mid-November through mid-february</span>, but I usually go in mid-December, during the
            holidays, as
            I’ve made it somewhat of a tradition to go with my father, who is also a photographer and lives nearby. We always
            bring
            our cameras, and I look forward to our day trip all year long, but I also love our tradition of stopping at the
            Buckhorn
            Tavern for a famous green chile burger at the end of a long day in the field.
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            Most Snow Geese come from Northern Canada, flying up to 1500 miles and cruising along at 40 miles per hour. They
            mate
            for life, so they are cruising along with their partner and sometimes their young.
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            Sandhill Cranes are much larger, standing 3-4 feet tall and have a massive wingspan of 6 feet. They breed in Canada,
            <span>Alaska and Siberia</span> and although they were once almost extinct, they have recovered dramatically because of places
            like
            this National Wildlife Refuge.
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            They also have an incredible sound that is very distinct, I imagine a pterodactyl would sound like this,

        <br><br>
        
        <p>Rosie the Riveter, meet your adorable present-day inspiration, Rosie the penguin from the <span>OdySea Aquarium in
        Scottsdale</span>,
            Arizona</p>
        
        <img src="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ5OTAzZjAxLWI5MjgtNGFlZS04ODM5LTUzMmUwNGMyYzQ5NjoxYzEwODlkZi04MDk0LTQwOWMtODgxNi1iY2FkZGM0ODc5Nzk=.jpg?crop=3:2,smart&width=640&quality=65"

        <br><br>
        
        <p>When we think of disabilities, we often do not think about them in tandem with animals, especially penguins. Meet
            Rosie,
            an eight-month-old African penguin with physical disabilities located at the OdySea Aquarium in Scottsdale, AZ.
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            Rosie hatched in <span>December 2019</span>, becoming penguin #39 in the colony at Penguin Point exhibit. Rosie’s parents, Mojo
            and
            Lemieux, became first-time parents, making Rosie “genetically valuable to the endangered African penguin species,”
            according to the OdySea Aquarium
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            During a health exam or “chick check,” Director & Veterinarian <span>Dr. Eric Anderson</span> and his team noticed that despite
            Rosie
            putting on weight and growing on track, Rosie was unable to sit up on her own. Normally when chicks hatch, they are
            unable to sit up on their own for the first few days but eventually develop the strength to start sitting up without
            their parent’s assistance. When the team saw unusual progress for Rosie, they knew something was not right.
        
            <br><br><br>
        
            The team installed 24/7 camera observations on Rosie and her family in their nest in order to oversee the chick
            without
            any intrusion. Beneficial to the Animal Care Team, they were able to gather a better understanding of <span>Mojo and
            Lemieux’s</span>
            parenting, as well as Rosie’s behavior. Jessica Peranteau, director of animal care and Education at OdySea Aquarium
            explained, “[w]e suspected the parents may have been overly protective...Our fear was that in their attempt to
            protect
            and incubate their baby, they were inhibiting Rosie’s ability to move about the nest area on her own and
            appropriately
            develop.”
